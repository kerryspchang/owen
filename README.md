# OpenWhisk Entity Browser
Run:

 1. `npm install -g web`
 2. `wab`

You are expected to have working OpenWhisk credentials. In particular, the file ~/.wskprops should exist and be complete.

If you can run wsk activation list without issue you are probably all set.

Note that web requires Node 6 or later.
